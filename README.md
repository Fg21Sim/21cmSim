# 21cmSim
21cm Signal Simulation Tool for Fg21Sim+

## Language & Dependency
21cmSim is a Python-based simulation tool. The cosmological simulation of 21 cm signals utilizes the [`21cmFAST`](https://github.com/21cmfast/21cmFAST) pkg. Check out the [requirements](https://github.com/Fg21Sim/21cmSim/blob/main/requirements.md) doc.

## Data Requirements
- `21cmFAST` lightcones:
  - Run the simulation with `21cmFAST` first;
  - Existing Lightcone: 
    - [EOS Porject](http://homepage.sns.it/mesinger/EOS.html);
    - High resolution lightcones by Chenxi
- Other lightcones
